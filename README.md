# Unity WebGL Multiplayer Online Radio

## Introduction
This project is an open-source initiative allowing players to enjoy music together in a shared virtual space. They can listen to music and communicate with each other in real-time.
Incorporating the doomer music radio with a dynamic image slideshow into your Unity project not only enhances the user experience but also deepens the engagement with the doomer subculture.

## Features
- **Multiplayer Experience**: Enjoy music with friends and other users in a real-time shared environment.
- **Communication**: Chat for users to communicate while listening to music.
- **Dynamic Playlists**: Users can suggest next song for voting
